# Module17-Challenge

## Overview:
The objective of this Module was to gÂ¿evaluate new machine learning models  to predict credit risk.

## Results:

##### Naive Random Oversampling:
  - Balanced Accuracy Score: 64.5%. 
  - High Risk Precision:0.01
  - High Risk Recall: 0.61
  - Low Risk Precision: 1.00
  - Low Risk Recall: 0.68
##### SMOTE Oversampling:
  - Balanced Accuracy Score: 62.9%. 
  - High Risk Precision:0.01
  - High Risk Recall: 0.63
  - Low Risk Precision: 1.00
  - Low Risk Recall: 0.63
##### Cluster Centroid Undersampling:
  - Balanced Accuracy Score: 52.0%. 
  - High Risk Precision:0.01
  - High Risk Recall: 0.60
  - Low Risk Precision: 1.00
  - Low Risk Recall: 0.44
##### SMOTEENN Combination (Over and Under) Sampling:
  - Balanced Accuracy Score: 63.9%. 
  - High Risk Precision:0.01
  - High Risk Recall: 0.69
  - Low Risk Precision: 1.00
  - Low Risk Recall: 0.59

##### Balanced Random Forest Classifier:
  - Balanced Accuracy Score: 73.4%. 
  - High Risk Precision:0.02
  - High Risk Recall: 0.60
  - Low Risk Precision: 1.00
  - Low Risk Recall: 0.87
##### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier: 
  - Balanced Accuracy Score: 92.6%. 
  - High Risk Precision:0.08
  - High Risk Recall: 0.91
  - Low Risk Precision: 1.00
  - Low Risk Recall: 0.94

## Summary:
Looking at the results we may say that adaboost classifier yield to the best metrics of both high risk and low risk loan application.
